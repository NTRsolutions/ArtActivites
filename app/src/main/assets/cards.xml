            <step>Fold the paper in half so that the two long sides match up. Unfold the paper and cut along the creased line. You should now have two 4¼x11" (11x28cm) strips of paper.</step>
            <step>With one of the paper strips, start from the short edge and fold back and forth every ¾" (2cm), like a fan.</step>
            <step>Gently, fold the fanned paper in half to make a crease in the middle.</step>
            <step>Place a staple in the middle of the paper along the center crease. Your paper will look like a bow tie.</step>
            <step>Use your pencil to draw a few small triangles or half circles along the folded edges of you paper. With scissors, cut out these simple shapes. Be sure not to cut all the way across the foleded paper. Snip the corners off to round out your flake.</step>
            <step>Carefully open the paper on both sides of the staple. Glue the edges together to create a round snowflake. You can use paper clips to hold the paper together while the glue dries.</step>
            <step>After the glue has dried, remove the paper clips and tie a string through one of the holes of the snowflake. Hang your snowflake from a window sill or in you bedroom.</step>
