            <step>Use your ruler and pencil to draw 16 equal squares on the cardboard. Cut out all the squares.</step>
            <step>Divide the squares up into eight sets of two squares. Draw an identical picture on each of the eight sets. For example draw a spaceship on two squares, a moon on two other squares, etc.</step>
            <step>When all the pictures are complete, mix up the pieces and place them face-down on your playing surface.</step>
            <step>Each player will turn over two squares at a time. If the pictures on your squares match, keep them and turn over two more squares. If the cards don't match turn them face-down again and let your friend take a turn. The person with the most matched squares wins the game!</step>

            <step>Fold the paper in half so that the two long sides match up. Unfold the paper and cut along the creased line. You should now have two 4¼x11" (11x28cm) strips of paper.</step>
            <step>With one of the paper strips, start from the short edge and fold back and forth every ¾" (2cm), like a fan.</step>
            <step>Gently, fold the fanned paper in half to make a crease in the middle.</step>
            <step>Place a staple in the middle of the paper along the center crease. Your paper will look like a bow tie.</step>
            <step>Use your pencil to draw a few small triangles or half circles along the folded edges of you paper. With scissors, cut out these simple shapes. Be sure not to cut all the way across the folded paper. Snip the corners off to round out your flake.</step>
            <step>Carefully open the paper on both sides of the staple. Glue the edges together to create a round snowflake. You can use paper clips to hold the paper together while the glue dries.</step>
            <step>After the glue has dried, remove the paper clips and tie a string through one of the holes of the snowflake. Hang your snowflake from a window sill or in you bedroom.</step>

            <step>Make a peace sign with your non-scissors-using hand, then put the two fingers that are sticking out together. Take yarn and gently wrap it around those two fingers about 75 times.</step>
            <step>Ask an adult to carefully slip the scissors between your two fingers and cut the whole bundle of yarn. It will pop off your fingers onto the table. Then, cut the yarn pieces in half and gather them into a pile.</step>
            <step>Cut a piece of yarn about 8" (20cm) long, and lay it on the table. Place your pile of short yarn pieces crosswise on the single piece of yarn. Bring the ends of the single piece up and tie them in a very tight knot, forcing the short yarn pieces into a tight bundle ... somewhat resembling a pom-pom.</step>
            <step>Give it a haircut. Use the scissors to trim the ends of the strands of yarn that are sticking out, until you get a nice round fuzz-ball.</step>
            <step>Cut a heart-shaped piece of felt a little bit bigger than your fuzz-ball, set it on the table, add a dab of glue, and set your fuzz-ball on it. Now you have made little shoes for you Fuzzy Buddy. Glue on googly eyes, and a different colored piece of yarn for a happy smile. Use felt to make hats, sunglasses, clothes, and all kinds of fuzzy accessories for your new buddy of fuzz. Then make some fuzzy friends for your first Fuzzy Buddy.</step>

            <step>Cut slits along each crease from the corner, to approximately 1" (2.5 cm) from the center point. You should have four triangles connected at the center.</step>
            <step>Gently curl one corner up to the center point and hold in place. Repeat this curling with every other corner. Carefully insert push pin through each corner and the center point. You may need someone to help you with this step.</step>
            <step>Finally, insert the push pin into the eraser of your pencil. Now, you can poke your pencil into the dirt of a potted plant and wait for a breeze to push your pinwheel around and around.</step>

Create beautiful designs, creatures, houses, landscapes, flowers ... anything you want to dream up. You don't need any more glue; the fuzz on the backboard will hold the fuzzy felt shapes in place, but it's easy to pick them up and move them around. Have fuzzy felt fun!</step>

            <step>Cut two pieces of green construction paper the length of your toilet tissue tubes, and wide enough to wrap fully around each one with about ½" (2 cm) overlap. On each sheet, mark the two edges that will go at the either end of the tubes by making a black stripe along them, about ¼" (1 cm) wide.</step>
            <step>Using brown and black markers, color blob shapes on top of the green paper, leaving some green showing through. This will make a camouflage pattern to keep you from being seen when you're spying.</step>
            <step>With the foam brush, coat the back of your camouflage paper with glue and wrap each sheet onto a tube. Note that the black stripes from the eyepieces and lenses at the ends of the tubes.</step>
            <step>Run a bead of glue down one of the tubes at the paper seam, and attach the second tube, with the seam side in. Paper clip the tubes together at both ends, and secure with a rubber band while the glue dries.</step>
            <step>Remove the paper clips and rubber band, and go on a spy mission!</step>

            <step>With a pencil, draw a few 1" (2½ cm) circles on the inside of your box lid. Poke the center of each circle with scissors to get a hole started, then cut out the circles.</step>
            <step>With crayons, color the inside of the lid with cool pinball designs, covering the entire surface with color. When you're finished coloring, use the paper towel to buff the surface of your crayon design to create a nice smooth, slippery surface on which your penny can glide.</step>
            <step>Take some bobby pins and clip them to your box lid through the holes you made. You can also poke a few holes in the sides of your box lid and insert bobby pins from the sides. Make sure the wavy sides of the bobby pins are on your colored surface and the straight sides are below. Turn the bobby pins in different directions to make an obstacle course for your penny.</step>
            <step>Place your penny at the top of your pinball machine and make it glide around between the bobby pins, avoiding the holes. Try to get it all the way to the bottom and back to the top as fast as you can. Have your friend time you, then take turns trying to beat your best times.</step>

Lay one cross over the other diagonally and tape together.</step>
            <step>Bend each strip so that the opposite ends match up. Tap the ends together. You should now have a sphere shape. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with the other sets of strips to make two more spheres.</step>

Make sure you keep glued items away from the edges of the lid, so they don't get in the way when you screw the lid back onto the jar.</step>
            <step>Fill your jar about ¾ full with water. To prevent a mess, set your jar down in the sink and add corn syrup to the water until it's just about full. Add a teaspoon or so of glitter.</step>
