  -- Log file to keep track of work done for Art Card Project --

  Created this log file to keep track of work being done on project.

  So, far have made the following layouts:
      activity_main.xml
      card_layout.xml
      list_itme.xml

  The following .java Class files:
      Card.java			Defines the Card Class.
      CardActivity.java		Activity to display a Card Class item
      MainActivity.java		Activity 
      XMLPullParserHandler.java	Java Class used to Parse cards.xml file.


  Currently the main activity displays a search box and button at the top with
  a ListView below showing the Cards' name and description.

  If a word is typed into the search box and the button pressed the list will
  be shortened to show only those Cards which have the search term in the Materials List

  If a card is clicked in the list the Card Activity is activated and displays the
  selected card.

  TODO:: Fix Card Activity layout for horizontal orientation.

  TODO:: Create New Main Activity layout that allows user to choose between:
        Activity of the Day
        Random Activity
        Search for Activity  ( by name, description or materials )
        View Favorite Activites

   TODO:: add way to save favorited activites
